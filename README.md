This is a solution to the [Interactive pricing component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the application locally: `npm start`

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers
